       " issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First, that" \
       " the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world." \
       " Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a" \

        " possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images. Along with the increase of" \
        " market potential, the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very" \
        " crucial one, because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data" \
        " exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection." \
        " Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that" \
        " obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with" \
        " existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations, the contribution of this work" \
        " is twofold: assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based" \
        " copyright protection, and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet" \
        " such constraints. More specifically, the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two" \
        " possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure" \
        " the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application, i.e., unsupervised image" \
